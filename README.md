Word Incorporation:
Some generators allow you to add a word or phrase to your password, making it more memorable while still being strong. 
Randomness:
Good generators produce genuinely random passwords, making them difficult to guess or crack. 
Benefits of using a customizable password generator:
Stronger Passwords:
Customizable generators allow you to create passwords that are more complex and harder to crack.

By generating unique passwords for each account, you reduce the risk of a hacked account compromising other accounts.
