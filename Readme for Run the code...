🪟 How to Run on Windows
✅ 1. Make sure Python is installed
Open Command Prompt and check:

bash
python --version
If not installed, download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure to check the box “Add Python to PATH” during installation.

✅ 2. Save the script
Open Notepad or any text editor.

Paste your Python code.

Save the file as password_generator.py (make sure the extension is .py, not .txt).

✅ 3. Run the script
Open Command Prompt, navigate to the folder where the script is saved using cd:

bash
cd path\to\your\folder
Run the script:
bash
python password_generator.py
The program will run in the terminal and prompt you for inputs.

🐧 How to Run on Linux
✅ 1. Check if Python is installed
Open a terminal and type:
bash
python3 --version
If not installed:
bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
✅ 2. Save the script
Open any text editor (e.g., gedit, nano, or VS Code).

Paste your Python code.

Save it as password_generator.py.

Example with nano:
bash
nano password_generator.py
Paste the code, press Ctrl+O to save, then Ctrl+X to exit.

✅ 3. Run the script
In the terminal:
bash
python3 password_generator.py
📁 Output Location
The generated passwords are saved in a file named:
generated_passwords.txt
This file will be located in the same folder where the Python script is run.

✅ Example Result
If you generate 3 passwords with base name "OpenAI", total length 14, and mixed characters, the terminal might show:
Generated Passwords:
1: OpenAI3#dKe8p@
2: zY@8OpenAIv93q
3: 6!XOpenAI7&2sd
And these same lines will be written to generated_passwords.txt.
